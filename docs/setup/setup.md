# Setup

This section will walk you through setting up Clara DICOM Adapter using the [Clara Deploy AI COVID-19 Classification Pipeline](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/resources/nvidia:clara:clara_ai_covid19_pipeline)
as an example.

## Install Clara DICOM Adapter Helm Chart

To install the Clara DICOM Adapter Helm Chart, please follow these steps:

1. If the system doesn't already have Docker and Kubernetes installed, first run the [Bootstrap script](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/resources/nvidia:clara:clara_bootstrap).
2. Install [Clara Deploy CLI](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/resources/nvidia:clara:clara_cli).
3. Install the Clara DICOM Adapter Helm Chart using the following command:

```bash
$ clara pull dicom
```

Next, we'll configure the Clara DICOM Adapter.

## Configure Storage Mount

DICOM Adapter, by default, stores all received DICOM instances temporarily under `/clara-io/clara-core/payloads` which is mounted
to `/payloads` inside the DICOM Adapter container.

Disk storage size required for the temporary space depends on many factors: size per job, time to process each pipeline per job and the total number of 
jobs per day, etc.  It is advised to allocate enough space for the temporary space or perhaps mount `/clara-io` on an network attached
storage (NAS) devices.

> [!Note]
> To change the default storage location on the host machine , find and modify the `hostPath` property in
> `~/.clara/charts/dicom-adapter/values.yaml` and restart the DICOM Adapter.

> [!Note]
> The default size of the persistent volume claim created for the mount is 50Gi.
> To increase or decrease the size of the volume claim, find and modify the `volumeSize` property in
> `~/.clara/charts/dicom-adapter/values.yaml` and restart the DICOM Adapter.


## Configuring Clara DICOM Adapter

The DICOM Adapter configuration is stored as JSON in `~/.clara/charts/dicom-adapter/files/appsettings.json`.
The default settings enable DICOM *C-STORE SCP* and *C-STORE-SCU* and set listening on port `104`.


### Default Settings (appsettings.json)

``` json

    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

Please refer to [Configuration Schema](schema.md) for a complete reference.


## Starting Clara DICOM Adapter

Once you have configured the Clara DICOM Adapter, run the following command to start the service:

```bash
clara dicom start
```

## Enable Incoming Associations

Before setting up a new *Clara AE Title*, you must first register the COVID-19 pipeline: Refer
to the [COVID-19 Setup Guide](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/resources/nvidia:clara:clara_ai_covid19_pipeline/setup)
to register the pipeline.

Once you have registered the pipeline with *Clara Platform* and have the **Pipeline ID**, you can
now set up a new *Clara AE Title* to accept DICOM associations and store DICOM instances.

First, create a new *Clara AE Title*:

```bash
$ clara dicom create aetitle -a COVIDAET pipeline-covid=<PIPELINE-ID>
```

.. Note:: Per the DICOM standard, the length of the `ae-Title` value should not exceed 16
          characters.

Next, create a DICOM Source to allow that DICOM device to communicate with the DICOM Adapter:

```
$ clara dicom create -a MYPACS -i 10.20.30.1
```

Now you have a DICOM device with the AE Title `MYPACS` registered at IP address `10.20.30.1`, and
*Clara DICOM Adapter* will now accept DICOM associations from this device.

.. Note:: If you would like DICOM Adapter to accept any incoming DICOM association without
          verifying the source, you may set `DicomAdapter>dicom>scp>reject-unknown-sources` to
         `false` in the configuration file.

## Exporting Processed Results

If the pipeline (in this case, the COVID-19 pipeline) generates results in DICOM format and needs
to export the results back to a DICOM device (e.g. PACS), you will need to create a DICOM
destination:

```bash
$ clara dicom create dest -n MYPACS -a MYPACSAET -i 10.20.30.2 -p 1104 
```

With the command and arguments above, we have created a new DICOM Destination named `MYPACS` with
the AE Title `MYPACSAET`, at IP address `10.20.30.2` and port  `1104`.  Please note that the
name argument (`-n`) must match the arguments defined in the pipeline. Please refer to [Register Results Operator](/sdk/Services/ResultsService/public/docs/README.md)
for a complete reference.

## Summary

With all the steps completed above, the Clara DICOM Adapter is now ready to receive DICOM 
associations with the AE Title **COVIDAET**. To summarize, you've done the following:

1. Install the Clara DICOM Adapter Helm Chart.
2. Register the COVID-19 pipeline with Clara.
3. Set up the Clara AE Title to run the COVID-19 pipeline.
4. Set up the DICOM Source to allow incoming association requests.
5. Set up the DICOM Destination for exporting processed results.
